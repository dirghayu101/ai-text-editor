/* 

-> I can have something to lock notes in the app. Maybe some sorta thing in which only if the user provides a key they can decrypt the note they have made. 
Even server cannot do anything if the user forgets the key.

-> The key can be something like your first pet dog name or something on similar line and there can be a hint option to give suggestions in case the user get struck.

-> The user interface should look good. There should be a dynamic number giver for your password. Like it will rate your password live from 1 to 100 while you type it.

-> I can use Bard's API and can have multiple rewritten form of the same text. It's not just some web app to make quick notes, it should be a place where you can stack up different forms of written thing you have. 

-> A writer has different moods, sometimes they are just writing some random emotional journal. This application should be my personalized thing and will focus a lot on the written materials arrangement. I don't want to throw everything on the same user interface.

-> It would be nice if a writer can collaborate with others on a written work. Or maybe have some whiteboard sorta thing to go wild with all their ideas.
