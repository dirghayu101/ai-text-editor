/* 

These are the possible knowledge gaps I can see:

1. I don't know redux and I will be needing something for state management.

2. I don't know responsive design and this project should be accessible by both your mobile and your desktop or whatever screen size you use.

3. I want to use some framework for styling, I don't want to go around breaking my head with plain CSS. I want to know how to use tailwind or something in my current project.
